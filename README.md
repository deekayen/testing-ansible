# Testing Ansible Examples

This repository contains examples written to illustrate [Testing Ansible](https://testingansible.rocks/), a book on producing and maintaining quality [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/) orchestration by [David Norman](https://dkn.me/).

Some of the playbooks and examples intentionally sneer at the formatting guidelines which have become commonplace for standardizing Ansible configuration. These examples presume some prior knowledge and experience with Ansible. For an introduction to the basics of Ansible, its capabilities, and other instruction for beginners, start with [Ansible for DevOps](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com/) by [Jeff Geerling](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/).
